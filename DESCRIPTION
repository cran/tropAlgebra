Description: It includes functions like tropical addition, tropical multiplication for vectors and matrices. In tropical algebra, the tropical sum of two numbers is their minimum and the tropical product of two numbers is their ordinary sum. For more information see also I. Simon (1988) Recognizable sets with multiplicities in the tropical semi ring: Volume 324 Lecture Notes I Computer Science, pages 107-120 <doi: 10.1007/BFb0017135>.
